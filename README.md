Existing Features:

List of player names (This currently can add but not remove people, there isn't enough info in the log file for that)
Stream the contents of the log file.
Clears out log file periodically stop it getting too large.

When a player leaves the server they won't be removed from the user list.
Found if a player joins/leaves VERY VERY quickly, this can cause the count of connected players to become incorrect.
